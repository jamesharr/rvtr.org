2012-07-30  RVTR Meeting Minutes
In the RVTR parking lot
======================================================================
20:00
* Meeting begins. ~65 attendees.
* Prospective members sign up sheet passed around for open for everyone attending throughout the meeting. Next month we'll take money for the membership dues, not tonight. 
* The big things coming up for 2013 will be the 3 tracks: Mini-bike track, big-bike track, quad track. The bike tracks will have guard railings, but quad track railing not in the budget for the current grant.
* The tracks will be free to use (just like the rest of the park), you just need your DNR sticker as always.
* Pumps from the river will be used to help maintain the tracks.
* Also in grant: Big chainsaw, top-handle saw to trim the trails.
* Work days: Have no budget yet, need logs for members who want to join the work days.
* David (DNR) is happy with park and what's going on down here. 
* Ryan (DNR officer) has a couple of issues for the club to address. 
* Russell read the introductory parts of the grant to the group. 
  * Goal: 50 club members. 
* This year: main focus is getting tracks built: grading, building, guard rails built, chainsaws. Other grant items: minor maintenance items.
* $600 + $1000 for chainsaws.
* Welder/generator should arrive from a previous year grant. 
* $33,610 guard railing for big bikes: 12" unistrut galvanized steel.
* Grading for ?? acres $28,650
* $22,000 for fuel, track building, travel expenses. 
* Steel storage building? Flood plane, we'll never get a building down here according to DNR engineers.  
* Next section: How many volunteer hours are being expended at the park. Forms will be online at some point where anyone who works on anything can fill out their hours so we have documentation of volunteer hours at the park.
* $2,500 fuel for all items in the containers.
* Russell read through the various ~$150 items included in the grant.
* $1,000 Reimbursement for officers that have put money out of their own pockets into the club. 
* Mule went down for service about a month ago. We're at $1500 or so for repairs so far, direct bill to DNR.
* Bobcat got serviced, direct bill to DNR. 
* $600 for signage.
* Any questions for the grant? Here's a copy here if anyone wants to look through it. We'll put a copy on the website. The big items were reviewed again.
* Question: Do we need / can we get flood insurance if we're going to spend $30K and then the river wipes it out again? Answer: Flood insurance isn't available in a flood plain. The bank is 15 foot higher than it was, the track will be higher, which is the best we can do with potential flooding. 
* Grant put to a vote. 57 members voted YES for the grant. 0 members voted NO on the grant. 
* Hare scrambles briefly discussed.
* 20:35 meeting adjourned.
