<h1>RVTR - Club Meeting Minutes</h1>

<i>These are my hastily jotted notes -- me typing as fast as I can manage
while people are talking. I hope they're mildly helpful to someone. 
I'm no stenographer. :)  -Jay</i>

<h2>2011-03-03</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should get a winch for the Mule if the have the money and/or approval through
the DNR while we have it ripped apart anyway.
<li>Waiting for the 3 bids to get the Mule repaired.
<li>Shane Watts Dirt Riding Academy - next available date is Sep 1/2. Open to 20 riders.
Advanced rider school is open to 7 applicants. $250-300. Would have to close the park 
for the class, sign waiver release. Thursday/Friday. Would require a special use permit
from the DNR. He asked if it's a public park, and if so it needs to be closed based on 
his experience trying to run these in public parks -- distractions, show-offs.
<li>Maybe Willow Creek would be more appropriate since the terrain is more challenging?
<li>Bike trail will be routed under the bridge (extended from the levy). 
Fence will be built to keep OHVs off of the bike trail.
<li>Need to finish the fencing (concrete?) to the new outhouse.
<li>Logan Iowa Hill Climb coming up: April 3, 2011. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hill-Blazers-mc-club/177338458975888">Hill Blazers MC Club on FaceBook</a>
<li>Sun Mar 20 will be a work day.
<li>Thr Mar 31 is the next club meeting instead of the first Thr of Apr.
<li>Sun May 22 will be a work day, right before Chris' deployment.
<li>Club poker run this year?
